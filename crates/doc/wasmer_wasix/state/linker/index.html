The linker is designed to
work with output from clang (version 19 was used at the time of creating this code).
Note that dynamic linking of WASM modules is considered unstable in clang/LLVM, so
this code may need to be updated for future versions of clang.</p>
<p>The linker doesn’t care about where code exists and how modules call each other, but
the way we have found to be most effective is:
* The main module carries with it all of wasix-libc, and exports everything
* Side module don’t link wasix-libc in, instead importing it from the main module</p>
<p>This way, we only need one instance of wasix-libc, and one instance of all the static
data that it requires to function. Indeed, if there were multiple instances of its
static data, it would more than likely just break completely; one needs only imagine
what would happen if there were multiple memory allocators (malloc) running at the same
time. Emscripten (the only WASM runtime that supports dynamic linking, at the time of
this writing) takes the same approach.</p>
<p>While locating modules by relative or absolute paths is possible, it is recommended
to put every side module into /lib, where they can be located by name as well as by
path.</p>
<p>The linker starts from a dynamically-linked main module. It scans the dylink.0 section
for memory and table-related information and the list of needed modules. The module
tree requires a memory, an indirect function table, and stack-related parameters
(including the __stack_pointer global), which are created. Since dynamically-linked
modules use PIC (position-independent code), the stack is not fixed and can be resized
at runtime.</p>
<p>After the memory, function table and stack are created, the linker proceeds to load in
needed modules. Needed modules are always loaded in and initialized before modules that
asked for them, since it is expected that the needed module needs to be usable before
the module that needs it can be initialized.</p>
<p>However, we also need to support circular dependencies between the modules; the most
common case is when the main needs a side module and imports function from it, and the
side imports wasix-libc functions from the main. To support this, the linker generates
stub functions for all the imports that cannot be resolved when a module is being
loaded in. The stub functions will then resolve the function once (and only once) at
runtime when they’re first called. This <em>does</em>, however, mean that link errors can happen
at runtime, after the linker has reported successful linking of the modules. Such errors
are turned into a <a href="../../enum.WasiError.html#variant.DlSymbolResolutionFailed" title="variant wasmer_wasix::WasiError::DlSymbolResolutionFailed"><code>WasiError::DlSymbolResolutionFailed</code></a> error and will terminate
execution completely.</p>
<h2 id="threading-support"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#threading-support">§</a>Threading Support</h2>
<p>The linker supports the concept of “Instance Groups”, which are multiple instances
of the same module tree. This corresponds very closely to WASIX threads, but is
named an instance group so as to keep the logic decoupled from the threading logic
in WASIX.</p>
<p>Each instance group has its own store, indirect function table, and stack pointer,
but shares its memory with every other instance group. Note that even though the
underlying memory is the same, we need to create a new <a href="../../syscalls/struct.Memory.html" title="struct wasmer_wasix::syscalls::Memory"><code>Memory</code></a> instance
for each group via <a href="../../syscalls/struct.Memory.html#method.share_in_store" title="method wasmer_wasix::syscalls::Memory::share_in_store"><code>Memory::share_in_store</code></a>. Also, when placing a symbol
in the function table, the linker always updates all function tables at the same
time. This is because function “pointers” can be passed across instance groups
(read: sent to other threads) by the guest code, so all function tables should
have exactly the same content at all times.</p>
<p>One important aspect of instance groups is that they do <em>not</em> share the same store;
this lets us put different instance groups on different OS threads. However, this
also means that one call to <a href="struct.Linker.html#method.load_module" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::Linker::load_module"><code>Linker::load_module</code></a>, etc. cannot update every
instance group as each one has its own function table. To make the linker work
across threads, we need a “stop-the-world” lock on every instance group. The group
the load/resolve request originates from sets a flag, which other instance
groups are required to check periodically by calling <a href="struct.Linker.html#method.do_pending_link_operations" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::Linker::do_pending_link_operations"><code>Linker::do_pending_link_operations</code></a>.
Once all instance groups are stopped in that function, the original can proceed to
perform the operation, and report its results to all other instance groups so they
can make the same changes to their function table as well.</p>
<p>In WASIX, the periodic check is performed at the start of most (but not all) syscalls.
This means a thread that doesn’t make any syscalls can potentially block all other
threads if a DL operation is performed. This also means that two instance groups
cannot co-exist on the same OS thread, as the first one will block the OS thread
and the second can’t enter the “lock” again to let the first continue its work.</p>
<p>To also get cooperation from threads that are waiting in a syscall, a
<a href="../../types/enum.Signal.html#variant.Sigwakeup" title="variant wasmer_wasix::types::Signal::Sigwakeup"><code>Signal::Sigwakeup</code></a> signal is sent to
all threads when a DL operation needs to be synchronized.</p>
<h2 id="about-tls"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#about-tls">§</a>About TLS</h2>
<p>Each instance of each group gets its own TLS area, so there are 4 cases to consider:
* Main instance of main module: TLS area will be allocated by the compiler, and be
placed at the start of the memory region requested by the <code>dylink.0</code> section.
* Main instance of side modules: Almost same as main module, but tls_base will be
non-zero because side modules get a non-zero memory_base. It is very important
to note that the main instance of a side module lives in the instance group
that initially loads it in. This <strong>does not</strong> have to be the main instance
group.
* Other instances of main module: Each worker thread gets its TLS area
allocated by the code in pthread_create, and a pointer to the TLS area is passed
through the thread start args. This pointer is read by the code in thread_spawn,
and passed through to us as part of the environment’s memory layout.
* Other instances of side modules: This is where the linker comes in. When the
new instance is created, the linker will call its <code>__wasix_init_tls</code> function,
which is responsible for setting up the TLS area for the thread.</p>
<p>Since we only want to call <code>__wasix_init_tls</code> for non-main instances of side modules,
it is enough to call it only within <a href="struct.InstanceGroupState.html#method.instantiate_side_module_from_linker" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InstanceGroupState::instantiate_side_module_from_linker"><code>InstanceGroupState::instantiate_side_module_from_linker</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="module-loading"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#module-loading">§</a>Module Loading</h2>
<p>Module loading happens as an orchestrated effort between the shared linker state, the
state of the instance group that started (or “instigated”) the operation, and other
instance groups. Access to a set of instances is required for resolution of exports,
which is why the linker state alone (which only stores modules) is not enough.</p>
<p>Even though most (if not all) operations require access to both the shared linker state
and a/the instance group state, they’re separated into three sets:
* Operations that deal with metadata exist as impls on <a href="struct.LinkerState.html" title="struct wasmer_wasix::state::linker::LinkerState"><code>LinkerState</code></a>. These take
a (read-only) instance group state for export resolution, as well as a
<a href="wasmer::StoreRef"><code>StoreRef</code></a>. They’re guaranteed not to alter the store or the
instance group state.
* Operations that deal with the actual instances (instantiating, putting symbols in the
function table, etc.) and are started by the instigating group exist as impls on
<a href="struct.InstanceGroupState.html" title="struct wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InstanceGroupState"><code>InstanceGroupState</code></a> that also take a mutable reference to the shared linker state, and
require it to be locked for writing. These operations can and will update the linker state,
mainly to store symbol resolution records.
* Operations that deal with replicating changes to instances from another thread also exits
as impls on <a href="struct.InstanceGroupState.html" title="struct wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InstanceGroupState"><code>InstanceGroupState</code></a>, but take a read-only reference to the shared linker
state. This is important because all the information needed for replicating the change to
the instigating group’s instances should already be in the linker state. See
<a href="struct.InstanceGroupState.html#method.populate_imports_from_linker" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InstanceGroupState::populate_imports_from_linker"><code>InstanceGroupState::populate_imports_from_linker</code></a> and
<a href="struct.InstanceGroupState.html#method.instantiate_side_module_from_linker" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InstanceGroupState::instantiate_side_module_from_linker"><code>InstanceGroupState::instantiate_side_module_from_linker</code></a> for the two most important ones.</p>
<p>Module loading generally works by going through these steps:
* <a href="struct.LinkerState.html#method.load_module_tree" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::LinkerState::load_module_tree"><code>LinkerState::load_module_tree</code></a> loads modules (and their needed modules) and assigns
module handles
* Then, for each new module:
* Memory and table space is allocated
* Imports are resolved (see next section)
* The module is instantiated
* After all modules have been instantiated, pending imports (resulting from circular
dependencies) are resolved
* Finally, module initializers are called</p>
<h3 id="symbol-resolution"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#symbol-resolution">§</a>Symbol resolution</h3>
<p>To support replicating operations from the instigating group to other groups, symbol resolution
happens in 3 steps:
* <a href="struct.LinkerState.html#method.resolve_symbols" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::LinkerState::resolve_symbols"><code>LinkerState::resolve_symbols</code></a> goes through the imports of a soon-to-be-loaded module,
recording the imports as <a href="struct.NeededSymbolResolutionKey.html" title="struct wasmer_wasix::state::linker::NeededSymbolResolutionKey"><code>NeededSymbolResolutionKey</code></a>s and creating
<a href="enum.InProgressSymbolResolution.html" title="enum wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InProgressSymbolResolution"><code>InProgressSymbolResolution</code></a>s in response to each one.
* <a href="struct.InstanceGroupState.html#method.populate_imports_from_link_state" title="method wasmer_wasix::state::linker::InstanceGroupState::populate_imports_from_link_state"><code>InstanceGroupState::populate_imports_from_link_state</code></a> then goes through the results
and resolves each import to its final value, while also recording enough information (in the
shape of <a href="enum.SymbolResolutionResult.html" title="enum wasmer_wasix::state::linker::SymbolResolutionResult"><code>SymbolResolutionResult</code></a>s) for other groups to resolve the symbol from their own
instances.
* Finally, instances are created and finalized, and initializers are called.</p>
<h3 id="stub-functions"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#stub-functions">§</a>Stub functions</h3>
<p>As noted above, stub functions are generated in response to circular dependencies. The stub
functions do take previous symbol resolution records into account, so that the stub corresponding
to a single import cannot resolve to different exports in different groups. If no such record is
found, then a new record is created by the stub function. However, there’s a catch.</p>
<p>It must be noted that, during initialization, the shared linker state has to remain write-locked
so as to prevent other threads from starting another operation (the replication logic only works
with one active operation at a time). Stub functions need a write lock on the shared linker state
to store new resolution records, and as such, they can’t store resolution records if they’re
called in response to a module’s initialization routines. This can happen easily if:</p>
<ul>
<li>A side module is needed by the main</li>
<li>That side module accesses any libc functions, such as printing something to stdout.</li>
</ul>
<p>To work around this, stub functions only <em>try</em> to lock the shared linker state, and if they can’t,
they won’t store anything. A follow-up call to the stub function can resolve the symbol again,
store it for use by further calls to the function, and also create a resolution record. This does
create a few hard-to-reach edge cases:
* If the symbol happens to resolve differently between the two calls to the stub, unpredictable
behavior can happen; however, this is impossible in the current implementation.
* If the shared state is locked by a different instance group, then the stub won’t store its
lookup results anyway, even though it could have if it had waited.</p>
<h3 id="locating-side-modules"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#locating-side-modules">§</a>Locating side modules</h3>
<p>Side modules are located according to these steps:
* If the name contains a slash (/), it is treated as a relative or absolute path.<br />
* Otherwise, the name is searched for in <code>/lib</code>, <code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not supported yet.</p>

<p>Note that building modules that conform the specific requirements of this linker requires
