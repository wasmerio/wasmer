The file system doesn’t return the [`File`] type directly, but rather this `FileHandle` type, which contains the inode, the flags, and (a light copy of) the filesystem. For each operations, it is checked that the permissions allow the operations to be executed, and then it is checked that the file still exists in the file system. After that, the operation is delegated to the file itself."]]};
