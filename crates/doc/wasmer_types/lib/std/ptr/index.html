<h2 id="safety"><a href="#safety">Safety</a></h2>
<p>Many functions in this module take raw pointers as arguments and read from
or write to them. For this to be safe, these pointers must be <em>valid</em>.
Whether a pointer is valid depends on the operation it is used for
(read or write), and the extent of the memory that is accessed (i.e.,
how many bytes are read/written). Most functions use <code>*mut T</code> and <code>*const T</code>
to access only a single value, in which case the documentation omits the size
and implicitly assumes it to be <code>size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> bytes.</p>
<p>The precise rules for validity are not determined yet. The guarantees that are
provided at this point are very minimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="fn.null.html" title="null">null</a> pointer is <em>never</em> valid, not even for accesses of <a href="../../nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">size zero</a>.</li>
<li>For a pointer to be valid, it is necessary, but not always sufficient, that the pointer
be <em>dereferenceable</em>: the memory range of the given size starting at the pointer must all be
within the bounds of a single allocated object. Note that in Rust,
every (stack-allocated) variable is considered a separate allocated object.</li>
<li>Even for operations of <a href="../../nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">size zero</a>, the pointer must not be pointing to deallocated
memory, i.e., deallocation makes pointers invalid even for zero-sized operations. However,
casting any non-zero integer <em>literal</em> to a pointer is valid for zero-sized accesses, even if
some memory happens to exist at that address and gets deallocated. This corresponds to writing
your own allocator: allocating zero-sized objects is not very hard. The canonical way to
obtain a pointer that is valid for zero-sized accesses is <a href="struct.NonNull.html#method.dangling" title="NonNull::dangling"><code>NonNull::dangling</code></a>.</li>
<li>All accesses performed by functions in this module are <em>non-atomic</em> in the sense
of <a href="../sync/atomic/index.html">atomic operations</a> used to synchronize between threads. This means it is
undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location from different
threads unless both accesses only read from memory. Notice that this explicitly
includes <a href="fn.read_volatile.html" title="read_volatile"><code>read_volatile</code></a> and <a href="fn.write_volatile.html" title="write_volatile"><code>write_volatile</code></a>: Volatile accesses cannot
be used for inter-thread synchronization.</li>
<li>The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the
underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to
access the same memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>These axioms, along with careful use of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset"><code>offset</code></a> for pointer arithmetic,
are enough to correctly implement many useful things in unsafe code. Stronger guarantees
will be provided eventually, as the <a href="../../nomicon/aliasing.html">aliasing</a> rules are being determined. For more
information, see the <a href="../../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer">book</a> as well as the section in the reference devoted
to <a href="../../reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>
<h3 id="alignment"><a href="#alignment">Alignment</a></h3>
<p>Valid raw pointers as defined above are not necessarily properly aligned (where
“proper” alignment is defined by the pointee type, i.e., <code>*const T</code> must be
aligned to <code>mem::align_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code>). However, most functions require their
arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state
this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are
<a href="fn.read_unaligned.html" title="read_unaligned"><code>read_unaligned</code></a> and <a href="fn.write_unaligned.html" title="write_unaligned"><code>write_unaligned</code></a>.</p>
<p>When a function requires proper alignment, it does so even if the access
has size 0, i.e., even if memory is not actually touched. Consider using
<a href="struct.NonNull.html#method.dangling" title="NonNull::dangling"><code>NonNull::dangling</code></a> in such cases.</p>
<h3 id="allocated-object"><a href="#allocated-object">Allocated object</a></h3>
<p>For several operations, such as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset"><code>offset</code></a> or field projections (<code>expr.field</code>), the notion of an
“allocated object” becomes relevant. An allocated object is a contiguous region of memory.
Common examples of allocated objects include stack-allocated variables (each variable is a
separate allocated object), heap allocations (each allocation created by the global allocator is
a separate allocated object), and <code>static</code> variables.</p>
<h2 id="strict-provenance"><a href="#strict-provenance">Strict Provenance</a></h2>
<p><strong>The following text is non-normative, insufficiently formal, and is an extremely strict
interpretation of provenance. It’s ok if your code doesn’t strictly conform to it.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a> is an experimental set of APIs that help tools that try
to validate the memory-safety of your program’s execution. Notably this includes <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a>
and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>, which can detect when you access out of bounds memory or otherwise violate
Rust’s memory model.</p>
<p>Provenance must exist in some form for any programming
language compiled for modern computer architectures, but specifying a model for provenance
in a way that is useful to both compilers and programmers is an ongoing challenge.
The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a> experiment seeks to explore the question: <em>what if we just said you
couldn’t do all the nasty operations that make provenance so messy?</em></p>
<p>What APIs would have to be removed? What APIs would have to be added? How much would code
have to change, and is it worse or better now? Would any patterns become truly inexpressible?
Could we carve out special exceptions for those patterns? Should we?</p>
<p>A secondary goal of this project is to see if we can disambiguate the many functions of
pointer&lt;-&gt;integer casts enough for the definition of <code>usize</code> to be loosened so that it
isn’t <em>pointer</em>-sized but address-space/offset/allocation-sized (we’ll probably continue
to conflate these notions). This would potentially make it possible to more efficiently
target platforms where pointers are larger than offsets, such as CHERI and maybe some
segmented architecures.</p>
<h3 id="provenance"><a href="#provenance">Provenance</a></h3>
<p><strong>This section is <em>non-normative</em> and is part of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a> experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Pointers are not <em>simply</em> an “integer” or “address”. For instance, it’s uncontroversial
to say that a Use After Free is clearly Undefined Behaviour, even if you “get lucky”
and the freed memory gets reallocated before your read/write (in fact this is the
worst-case scenario, UAFs would be much less concerning if this didn’t happen!).
To rationalize this claim, pointers need to somehow be <em>more</em> than just their addresses:
they must have provenance.</p>
<p>When an allocation is created, that allocation has a unique Original Pointer. For alloc
APIs this is literally the pointer the call returns, and for local variables and statics,
this is the name of the variable/static. This is mildly overloading the term “pointer”
for the sake of brevity/exposition.</p>
<p>The Original Pointer for an allocation is guaranteed to have unique access to the entire
allocation and <em>only</em> that allocation. In this sense, an allocation can be thought of
as a “sandbox” that cannot be broken into or out of. <em>Provenance</em> is the permission
to access an allocation’s sandbox and has both a <em>spatial</em> and <em>temporal</em> component:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial: A range of bytes that the pointer is allowed to access.</li>
<li>Temporal: The lifetime (of the allocation) that access to these bytes is tied to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spatial provenance makes sure you don’t go beyond your sandbox, while temporal provenance
makes sure that you can’t “get lucky” after your permission to access some memory
has been revoked (either through deallocations or borrows expiring).</p>
<p>Provenance is implicitly shared with all pointers transitively derived from
The Original Pointer through operations like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset"><code>offset</code></a>, borrowing, and pointer casts.
Some operations may <em>shrink</em> the derived provenance, limiting how much memory it can
access or how long it’s valid for (i.e. borrowing a subfield and subslicing).</p>
<p>Shrinking provenance cannot be undone: even if you “know” there is a larger allocation, you
can’t derive a pointer with a larger provenance. Similarly, you cannot “recombine”
two contiguous provenances back into one (i.e. with a <code>fn merge(&amp;[T], &amp;[T]) -&gt; &amp;[T]</code>).</p>
<p>A reference to a value always has provenance over exactly the memory that field occupies.
A reference to a slice always has provenance over exactly the range that slice describes.</p>
<p>If an allocation is deallocated, all pointers with provenance to that allocation become
invalidated, and effectively lose their provenance.</p>
<p>The strict provenance experiment is mostly only interested in exploring stricter <em>spatial</em>
provenance. In this sense it can be thought of as a subset of the more ambitious and
formal <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/stacked-borrows/">Stacked Borrows</a> research project, which is what tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> are based on.
In particular, Stacked Borrows is necessary to properly describe what borrows are allowed
to do and when they become invalidated. This necessarily involves much more complex
<em>temporal</em> reasoning than simply identifying allocations. Adjusting APIs and code
for the strict provenance experiment will also greatly help Stacked Borrows.</p>
<h3 id="pointer-vs-addresses"><a href="#pointer-vs-addresses">Pointer Vs Addresses</a></h3>
<p><strong>This section is <em>non-normative</em> and is part of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a> experiment.</strong></p>
<p>One of the largest historical issues with trying to define provenance is that programmers
freely convert between pointers and integers. Once you allow for this, it generally becomes
impossible to accurately track and preserve provenance information, and you need to appeal
to very complex and unreliable heuristics. But of course, converting between pointers and
integers is very useful, so what can we do?</p>
<p>Also did you know WASM is actually a “Harvard Architecture”? As in function pointers are
handled completely differently from data pointers? And we kind of just shipped Rust on WASM
without really addressing the fact that we let you freely convert between function pointers
and data pointers, because it mostly Just Works? Let’s just put that on the “pointer casts
are dubious” pile.</p>
<p>Strict Provenance attempts to square these circles by decoupling Rust’s traditional conflation
of pointers and <code>usize</code> (and <code>isize</code>), and defining a pointer to semantically contain the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>address-space</strong> it is part of (e.g. “data” vs “code” in WASM).</li>
<li>The <strong>address</strong> it points to, which can be represented by a <code>usize</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>provenance</strong> it has, defining the memory it has permission to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Strict Provenance, a usize <em>cannot</em> accurately represent a pointer, and converting from
a pointer to a usize is generally an operation which <em>only</em> extracts the address. It is
therefore <em>impossible</em> to construct a valid pointer from a usize because there is no way
to restore the address-space and provenance. In other words, pointer-integer-pointer
roundtrips are not possible (in the sense that the resulting pointer is not dereferencable).</p>
<p>The key insight to making this model <em>at all</em> viable is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.with_addr"><code>with_addr</code></a> method:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>    /// Creates a new pointer with the given address.
    ///
    /// This performs the same operation as an `addr as ptr` cast, but copies
    /// the *address-space* and *provenance* of `self` to the new pointer.
    /// This allows us to dynamically preserve and propagate this important
    /// information in a way that is otherwise impossible with a unary cast.
    ///
    /// This is equivalent to using `wrapping_offset` to offset `self` to the
    /// given address, and therefore has all the same capabilities and restrictions.
    pub fn with_addr(self, addr: usize) -&gt; Self;</code></pre></div>
<p>So you’re still able to drop down to the address representation and do whatever
clever bit tricks you want <em>as long as</em> you’re able to keep around a pointer
into the allocation you care about that can “reconstitute” the other parts of the pointer.
Usually this is very easy, because you only are taking a pointer, messing with the address,
and then immediately converting back to a pointer. To make this use case more ergonomic,
we provide the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.map_addr"><code>map_addr</code></a> method.</p>
<p>To help make it clear that code is “following” Strict Provenance semantics, we also provide an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.addr"><code>addr</code></a> method which promises that the returned address is not part of a
pointer-usize-pointer roundtrip. In the future we may provide a lint for pointer&lt;-&gt;integer
casts to help you audit if your code conforms to strict provenance.</p>
<h3 id="using-strict-provenance"><a href="#using-strict-provenance">Using Strict Provenance</a></h3>
<p>Most code needs no changes to conform to strict provenance, as the only really concerning
operation that <em>wasn’t</em> obviously already Undefined Behaviour is casts from usize to a
pointer. For code which <em>does</em> cast a usize to a pointer, the scope of the change depends
on exactly what you’re doing.</p>
<p>In general you just need to make sure that if you want to convert a usize address to a
pointer and then use that pointer to read/write memory, you need to keep around a pointer
that has sufficient provenance to perform that read/write itself. In this way all of your
casts from an address to a pointer are essentially just applying offsets/indexing.</p>
<p>This is generally trivial to do for simple cases like tagged pointers <em>as long as you
represent the tagged pointer as an actual pointer and not a usize</em>. For instance:</p>

<p>(Yes, if you’ve been using AtomicUsize for pointers in concurrent datastructures, you should
be using AtomicPtr instead. If that messes up the way you atomically manipulate pointers,
we would like to know why, and what needs to be done to fix it.)</p>
<p>Something more complicated and just generally <em>evil</em> like an XOR-List requires more significant
changes like allocating all nodes in a pre-allocated Vec or Arena and using a pointer
to the whole allocation to reconstitute the XORed addresses.</p>
<p>Situations where a valid pointer <em>must</em> be created from just an address, such as baremetal code
accessing a memory-mapped interface at a fixed address, are an open question on how to support.
These situations <em>will</em> still be allowed, but we might require some kind of “I know what I’m
doing” annotation to explain the situation to the compiler. It’s also possible they need no
special attention at all, because they’re generally accessing memory outside the scope of
“the abstract machine”, or already using “I know what I’m doing” annotations like “volatile”.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a> it is Undefined Behaviour to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Access memory through a pointer that does not have provenance over that memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset"><code>offset</code></a> a pointer to or from an address it doesn’t have provenance over.
This means it’s always UB to offset a pointer derived from something deallocated,
even if the offset is 0. Note that a pointer “one past the end” of its provenance
is not actually outside its provenance, it just has 0 bytes it can load/store.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it <em>is</em> still sound to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create an invalid pointer from just an address (see <a href="fn.invalid.html"><code>ptr::invalid</code></a>). This can
be used for sentinel values like <code>null</code> <em>or</em> to represent a tagged pointer that will
never be dereferencable. In general, it is always sound for an integer to pretend
to be a pointer “for fun” as long as you don’t use operations on it which require
it to be valid (offset, read, write, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forge an allocation of size zero at any sufficiently aligned non-null address.
i.e. the usual “ZSTs are fake, do what you want” rules apply <em>but</em> this only applies
for actual forgery (integers cast to pointers). If you borrow some struct’s field
that <em>happens</em> to be zero-sized, the resulting pointer will have provenance tied to
that allocation and it will still get invalidated if the allocation gets deallocated.
In the future we may introduce an API to make such a forged allocation explicit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.wrapping_offset"><code>wrapping_offset</code></a> a pointer outside its provenance. This includes invalid pointers
which have “no” provenance. Unfortunately there may be practical limits on this for a
particular platform, and it’s an open question as to how to specify this (if at all).
Notably, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> relies on a compression scheme that can’t handle a
pointer getting offset “too far” out of bounds. If this happens, the address
returned by <code>addr</code> will be the value you expect, but the provenance will get invalidated
and using it to read/write will fault. The details of this are architecture-specific
and based on alignment, but the buffer on either side of the pointer’s range is pretty
generous (think kilobytes, not bytes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare arbitrary pointers by address. Addresses <em>are</em> just integers and so there is
always a coherent answer, even if the pointers are invalid or from different
address-spaces/provenances. Of course, comparing addresses from different address-spaces
is generally going to be <em>meaningless</em>, but so is comparing Kilograms to Meters, and Rust
doesn’t prevent that either. Similarly, if you get “lucky” and notice that a pointer
one-past-the-end is the “same” address as the start of an unrelated allocation, anything
you do with that fact is <em>probably</em> going to be gibberish. The scope of that gibberish
is kept under control by the fact that the two pointers <em>still</em> aren’t allowed to access
the other’s allocation (bytes), because they still have different provenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform pointer tagging tricks. This falls out of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.wrapping_offset"><code>wrapping_offset</code></a> but is worth
mentioning in more detail because of the limitations of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>. Low-bit tagging
is very robust, and often doesn’t even go out of bounds because types ensure
size &gt;= align (and over-aligning actually gives CHERI more flexibility). Anything
more complex than this rapidly enters “extremely platform-specific” territory as
certain things may or may not be allowed based on specific supported operations.
For instance, ARM explicitly supports high-bit tagging, and so CHERI on ARM inherits
that and should support it.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This section is <em>non-normative</em> and is part of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a> experiment.</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above, pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips are not possible under <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">Strict Provenance</a>.
However, there exists legacy Rust code that is full of such roundtrips, and legacy platform APIs
regularly assume that <code>usize</code> can capture all the information that makes up a pointer. There
also might be code that cannot be ported to Strict Provenance (which is something we would <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">like
to hear about</a>).</p>
<p>For situations like this, there is a fallback plan, a way to ‘opt out’ of Strict Provenance.
However, note that this makes your code a lot harder to specify, and the code will not work
(well) with tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>.</p>
<p>This fallback plan is provided by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.expose_addr"><code>expose_addr</code></a> and <a href="fn.from_exposed_addr.html"><code>from_exposed_addr</code></a> methods (which
are equivalent to <code>as</code> casts between pointers and integers). <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.expose_addr"><code>expose_addr</code></a> is a lot like
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.addr"><code>addr</code></a>, but additionally adds the provenance of the pointer to a global list of ‘exposed’
provenances. (This list is purely conceptual, it exists for the purpose of specifying Rust but
is not materialized in actual executions, except in tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a>.) <a href="fn.from_exposed_addr.html"><code>from_exposed_addr</code></a>
can be used to construct a pointer with one of these previously ‘exposed’ provenances.
<a href="fn.from_exposed_addr.html"><code>from_exposed_addr</code></a> takes only <code>addr: usize</code> as arguments, so unlike in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.with_addr"><code>with_addr</code></a> there is
no indication of what the correct provenance for the returned pointer is – and that is exactly
what makes pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips so tricky to rigorously specify! There is no
algorithm that decides which provenance will be used. You can think of this as “guessing” the
right provenance, and the guess will be “maximally in your favor”, in the sense that if there is
any way to avoid undefined behavior, then that is the guess that will be taken. However, if
there is <em>no</em> previously ‘exposed’ provenance that justifies the way the returned pointer will
be used, the program has undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.expose_addr"><code>expose_addr</code></a> or <a href="fn.from_exposed_addr.html"><code>from_exposed_addr</code></a> (or the equivalent <code>as</code> casts) means that code is
<em>not</em> following Strict Provenance rules. The goal of the Strict Provenance experiment is to
determine whether it is possible to use Rust without <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.63.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.expose_addr"><code>expose_addr</code></a> and <a href="fn.from_exposed_addr.html"><code>from_exposed_addr</code></a>.
If this is successful, it would be a major win for avoiding specification complexity and to
facilitate adoption of tools like <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> that can be a big help in increasing the
confidence in (unsafe) Rust code.</p>
