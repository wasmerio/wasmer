<h2 id="safety"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#safety">§</a>Safety</h2>
<p>Many functions in this module take raw pointers as arguments and read from or write to them. For
this to be safe, these pointers must be <em>valid</em> for the given access. Whether a pointer is valid
depends on the operation it is used for (read or write), and the extent of the memory that is
accessed (i.e., how many bytes are read/written) – it makes no sense to ask “is this pointer
valid”; one has to ask “is this pointer valid for a given access”. Most functions use <code>*mut T</code>
and <code>*const T</code> to access only a single value, in which case the documentation omits the size and
implicitly assumes it to be <code>size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> bytes.</p>
<p>The precise rules for validity are not determined yet. The guarantees that are
provided at this point are very minimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>For memory accesses of <a href="../../nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">size zero</a>, <em>every</em> pointer is valid, including the <a href="fn.null.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::null">null</a>
pointer. The following points are only concerned with non-zero-sized accesses.</li>
<li>A <a href="fn.null.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::null">null</a> pointer is <em>never</em> valid.</li>
<li>For a pointer to be valid, it is necessary, but not always sufficient, that the pointer be
<em>dereferenceable</em>. The <a href="#provenance">provenance</a> of the pointer is used to determine which <a href="#allocated-object">allocated
object</a> it is derived from; a pointer is dereferenceable if the memory range of the given size
starting at the pointer is entirely contained within the bounds of that allocated object. Note
that in Rust, every (stack-allocated) variable is considered a separate allocated object.</li>
<li>All accesses performed by functions in this module are <em>non-atomic</em> in the sense
of <a href="../sync/atomic/index.html" title="mod wasmer_types::lib::std::sync::atomic">atomic operations</a> used to synchronize between threads. This means it is
undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location from different
threads unless both accesses only read from memory. Notice that this explicitly
includes <a href="fn.read_volatile.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::read_volatile"><code>read_volatile</code></a> and <a href="fn.write_volatile.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::write_volatile"><code>write_volatile</code></a>: Volatile accesses cannot
be used for inter-thread synchronization.</li>
<li>The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the
underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to
access the same memory. That is, reference and pointer accesses cannot be
interleaved.</li>
</ul>
<p>These axioms, along with careful use of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset" title="method pointer::offset"><code>offset</code></a> for pointer arithmetic,
are enough to correctly implement many useful things in unsafe code. Stronger guarantees
will be provided eventually, as the <a href="../../nomicon/aliasing.html">aliasing</a> rules are being determined. For more
information, see the <a href="../../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer">book</a> as well as the section in the reference devoted
to <a href="../../reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>
<p>We say that a pointer is “dangling” if it is not valid for any non-zero-sized accesses. This
means out-of-bounds pointers, pointers to freed memory, null pointers, and pointers created with
<a href="struct.NonNull.html#method.dangling" title="associated function wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::NonNull::dangling"><code>NonNull::dangling</code></a> are all dangling.</p>
<h3 id="alignment"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#alignment">§</a>Alignment</h3>
<p>Valid raw pointers as defined above are not necessarily properly aligned (where
“proper” alignment is defined by the pointee type, i.e., <code>*const T</code> must be
aligned to <code>align_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code>). However, most functions require their
arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state
this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are
<a href="fn.read_unaligned.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::read_unaligned"><code>read_unaligned</code></a> and <a href="fn.write_unaligned.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::write_unaligned"><code>write_unaligned</code></a>.</p>
<p>When a function requires proper alignment, it does so even if the access
has size 0, i.e., even if memory is not actually touched. Consider using
<a href="struct.NonNull.html#method.dangling" title="associated function wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::NonNull::dangling"><code>NonNull::dangling</code></a> in such cases.</p>
<h3 id="pointer-to-reference-conversion"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#pointer-to-reference-conversion">§</a>Pointer to reference conversion</h3>
<p>When converting a pointer to a reference (e.g. via <code>&amp;*ptr</code> or <code>&amp;mut *ptr</code>),
there are several rules that must be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pointer must be properly aligned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must be non-null.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must be “dereferenceable” in the sense defined above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pointer must point to a <a href="../../reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html#invalid-values">valid value</a> of type <code>T</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must enforce Rust’s aliasing rules. The exact aliasing rules are not decided yet, so we
only give a rough overview here. The rules also depend on whether a mutable or a shared
reference is being created.</p>
<ul>
<li>When creating a mutable reference, then while this reference exists, the memory it points to
must not get accessed (read or written) through any other pointer or reference not derived
from this reference.</li>
<li>When creating a shared reference, then while this reference exists, the memory it points to
must not get mutated (except inside <code>UnsafeCell</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a pointer follows all of these rules, it is said to be
<em>convertible to a (mutable or shared) reference</em>.</p>
<p>These rules apply even if the result is unused!
(The part about being initialized is not yet fully decided, but until
it is, the only safe approach is to ensure that they are indeed initialized.)</p>
<p>An example of the implications of the above rules is that an expression such
as <code>unsafe { &amp;*(0 as *const u8) }</code> is Immediate Undefined Behavior.</p>
<h3 id="allocated-object"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#allocated-object">§</a>Allocated object</h3>
<p>An <em>allocated object</em> is a subset of program memory which is addressable
from Rust, and within which pointer arithmetic is possible. Examples of
allocated objects include heap allocations, stack-allocated variables,
statics, and consts. The safety preconditions of some Rust operations -
such as <code>offset</code> and field projections (<code>expr.field</code>) - are defined in
terms of the allocated objects on which they operate.</p>
<p>An allocated object has a base address, a size, and a set of memory
addresses. It is possible for an allocated object to have zero size, but
such an allocated object will still have a base address. The base address
of an allocated object is not necessarily unique. While it is currently the
case that an allocated object always has a set of memory addresses which is
fully contiguous (i.e., has no “holes”), there is no guarantee that this
will not change in the future.</p>
<p>For any allocated object with <code>base</code> address, <code>size</code>, and a set of
<code>addresses</code>, the following are guaranteed:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all addresses <code>a</code> in <code>addresses</code>, <code>a</code> is in the range <code>base .. (base + size)</code> (note that this requires <code>a &lt; base + size</code>, not <code>a &lt;= base + size</code>)</li>
<li><code>base</code> is not equal to <a href="fn.null.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::null"><code>null()</code></a> (i.e., the address with the numerical
value 0)</li>
<li><code>base + size &lt;= usize::MAX</code></li>
<li><code>size &lt;= isize::MAX</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence of these guarantees, given any address <code>a</code> within the set
of addresses of an allocated object:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is guaranteed that <code>a - base</code> does not overflow <code>isize</code></li>
<li>It is guaranteed that <code>a - base</code> is non-negative</li>
<li>It is guaranteed that, given <code>o = a - base</code> (i.e., the offset of <code>a</code> within
the allocated object), <code>base + o</code> will not wrap around the address space (in
other words, will not overflow <code>usize</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="provenance"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#provenance">§</a>Provenance</h2>
<p>Pointers are not <em>simply</em> an “integer” or “address”. For instance, it’s uncontroversial
to say that a Use After Free is clearly Undefined Behavior, even if you “get lucky”
and the freed memory gets reallocated before your read/write (in fact this is the
worst-case scenario, UAFs would be much less concerning if this didn’t happen!).
As another example, consider that <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.wrapping_offset" title="method pointer::wrapping_offset"><code>wrapping_offset</code></a> is documented to “remember”
the allocated object that the original pointer points to, even if it is offset far
outside the memory range occupied by that allocated object.
To rationalize claims like this, pointers need to somehow be <em>more</em> than just their addresses:
they must have <strong>provenance</strong>.</p>
<p>A pointer value in Rust semantically contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>address</strong> it points to, which can be represented by a <code>usize</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>provenance</strong> it has, defining the memory it has permission to access. Provenance can be
absent, in which case the pointer does not have permission to access any memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact structure of provenance is not yet specified, but the permission defined by a
pointer’s provenance have a <em>spatial</em> component, a <em>temporal</em> component, and a <em>mutability</em>
component:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial: The set of memory addresses that the pointer is allowed to access.</li>
<li>Temporal: The timespan during which the pointer is allowed to access those memory addresses.</li>
<li>Mutability: Whether the pointer may only access the memory for reads, or also access it for
writes. Note that this can interact with the other components, e.g. a pointer might permit
mutation only for a subset of addresses, or only for a subset of its maximal timespan.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an <a href="#allocated-object">allocated object</a> is created, it has a unique Original Pointer. For alloc
APIs this is literally the pointer the call returns, and for local variables and statics,
this is the name of the variable/static. (This is mildly overloading the term “pointer”
for the sake of brevity/exposition.)</p>
<p>The Original Pointer for an allocated object has provenance that constrains the <em>spatial</em>
permissions of this pointer to the memory range of the allocation, and the <em>temporal</em>
permissions to the lifetime of the allocation. Provenance is implicitly inherited by all
pointers transitively derived from the Original Pointer through operations like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset" title="method pointer::offset"><code>offset</code></a>,
borrowing, and pointer casts. Some operations may <em>shrink</em> the permissions of the derived
provenance, limiting how much memory it can access or how long it’s valid for (i.e. borrowing a
subfield and subslicing can shrink the spatial component of provenance, and all borrowing can
shrink the temporal component of provenance). However, no operation can ever <em>grow</em> the
permissions of the derived provenance: even if you “know” there is a larger allocation, you
can’t derive a pointer with a larger provenance. Similarly, you cannot “recombine” two
contiguous provenances back into one (i.e. with a <code>fn merge(&amp;[T], &amp;[T]) -&gt; &amp;[T]</code>).</p>
<p>A reference to a place always has provenance over at least the memory that place occupies.
A reference to a slice always has provenance over at least the range that slice describes.
Whether and when exactly the provenance of a reference gets “shrunk” to <em>exactly</em> fit
the memory it points to is not yet determined.</p>
<p>A <em>shared</em> reference only ever has provenance that permits reading from memory,
and never permits writes, except inside <a href="../cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html" title="struct wasmer_types::lib::std::cell::UnsafeCell"><code>UnsafeCell</code></a>.</p>
<p>Provenance can affect whether a program has undefined behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is undefined behavior to access memory through a pointer that does not have provenance over
that memory. Note that a pointer “at the end” of its provenance is not actually outside its
provenance, it just has 0 bytes it can load/store. Zero-sized accesses do not require any
provenance since they access an empty range of memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is undefined behavior to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset" title="method pointer::offset"><code>offset</code></a> a pointer across a memory range that is not contained
in the allocated object it is derived from, or to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset_from" title="method pointer::offset_from"><code>offset_from</code></a> two pointers not derived
from the same allocated object. Provenance is used to say what exactly “derived from” even
means: the lineage of a pointer is traced back to the Original Pointer it descends from, and
that identifies the relevant allocated object. In particular, it’s always UB to offset a
pointer derived from something that is now deallocated, except if the offset is 0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it <em>is</em> still sound to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a pointer without provenance from just an address (see <a href="fn.without_provenance.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::without_provenance"><code>without_provenance</code></a>). Such a
pointer cannot be used for memory accesses (except for zero-sized accesses). This can still be
useful for sentinel values like <code>null</code> <em>or</em> to represent a tagged pointer that will never be
dereferenceable. In general, it is always sound for an integer to pretend to be a pointer “for
fun” as long as you don’t use operations on it which require it to be valid (non-zero-sized
offset, read, write, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forge an allocation of size zero at any sufficiently aligned non-null address.
i.e. the usual “ZSTs are fake, do what you want” rules apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.wrapping_offset" title="method pointer::wrapping_offset"><code>wrapping_offset</code></a> a pointer outside its provenance. This includes pointers
which have “no” provenance. In particular, this makes it sound to do pointer tagging tricks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare arbitrary pointers by address. Pointer comparison ignores provenance and addresses
<em>are</em> just integers, so there is always a coherent answer, even if the pointers are dangling
or from different provenances. Note that if you get “lucky” and notice that a pointer at the
end of one allocated object is the “same” address as the start of another allocated object,
anything you do with that fact is <em>probably</em> going to be gibberish. The scope of that
gibberish is kept under control by the fact that the two pointers <em>still</em> aren’t allowed to
access the other’s allocation (bytes), because they still have different provenance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the full definition of provenance in Rust is not decided yet, as this interacts
with the as-yet undecided <a href="../../nomicon/aliasing.html">aliasing</a> rules.</p>
<h3 id="pointers-vs-integers"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#pointers-vs-integers">§</a>Pointers Vs Integers</h3>
<p>From this discussion, it becomes very clear that a <code>usize</code> <em>cannot</em> accurately represent a pointer,
and converting from a pointer to a <code>usize</code> is generally an operation which <em>only</em> extracts the
address. Converting this address back into pointer requires somehow answering the question:
which provenance should the resulting pointer have?</p>
<p>Rust provides two ways of dealing with this situation: <em>Strict Provenance</em> and <em>Exposed Provenance</em>.</p>
<p>Note that a pointer <em>can</em> represent a <code>usize</code> (via <a href="fn.without_provenance.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::without_provenance"><code>without_provenance</code></a>), so the right type to
use in situations where a value is “sometimes a pointer and sometimes a bare <code>usize</code>” is a
pointer type.</p>
<h3 id="strict-provenance"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#strict-provenance">§</a>Strict Provenance</h3>
<p>“Strict Provenance” refers to a set of APIs designed to make working with provenance more
explicit. They are intended as substitutes for casting a pointer to an integer and back.</p>
<p>Entirely avoiding integer-to-pointer casts successfully side-steps the inherent ambiguity of
that operation. This benefits compiler optimizations, and it is pretty much a requirement for
using tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> and architectures like <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> that aim to detect and diagnose pointer
misuse.</p>
<p>The key insight to making programming without integer-to-pointer casts <em>at all</em> viable is the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.with_addr" title="method pointer::with_addr"><code>with_addr</code></a> method:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>    /// Creates a new pointer with the given address.
    ///
    /// This performs the same operation as an `addr as ptr` cast, but copies
    /// the *provenance* of `self` to the new pointer.
    /// This allows us to dynamically preserve and propagate this important
    /// information in a way that is otherwise impossible with a unary cast.
    ///
    /// This is equivalent to using `wrapping_offset` to offset `self` to the
    /// given address, and therefore has all the same capabilities and restrictions.
    pub fn with_addr(self, addr: usize) -&gt; Self;</code></pre></div>
<p>So you’re still able to drop down to the address representation and do whatever
clever bit tricks you want <em>as long as</em> you’re able to keep around a pointer
into the allocation you care about that can “reconstitute” the provenance.
Usually this is very easy, because you only are taking a pointer, messing with the address,
and then immediately converting back to a pointer. To make this use case more ergonomic,
we provide the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.map_addr" title="method pointer::map_addr"><code>map_addr</code></a> method.</p>
<p>To help make it clear that code is “following” Strict Provenance semantics, we also provide an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.addr" title="method pointer::addr"><code>addr</code></a> method which promises that the returned address is not part of a
pointer-integer-pointer roundtrip. In the future we may provide a lint for pointer&lt;-&gt;integer
casts to help you audit if your code conforms to strict provenance.</p>
<h4 id="using-strict-provenance"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#using-strict-provenance">§</a>Using Strict Provenance</h4>
<p>Most code needs no changes to conform to strict provenance, as the only really concerning
operation is casts from usize to a pointer. For code which <em>does</em> cast a <code>usize</code> to a pointer,
the scope of the change depends on exactly what you’re doing.</p>
<p>In general, you just need to make sure that if you want to convert a <code>usize</code> address to a
pointer and then use that pointer to read/write memory, you need to keep around a pointer
that has sufficient provenance to perform that read/write itself. In this way all of your
casts from an address to a pointer are essentially just applying offsets/indexing.</p>
<p>This is generally trivial to do for simple cases like tagged pointers <em>as long as you
represent the tagged pointer as an actual pointer and not a <code>usize</code></em>. For instance:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">unsafe </span>{
    <span class="comment">// A flag we want to pack into our pointer
    </span><span class="kw">static </span>HAS_DATA: usize = <span class="number">0x1</span>;

        <span class="macro">assert_eq!</span>(data, <span class="number">17</span>);
    } <span class="kw">else </span>{
        <span class="macro">unreachable!</span>()
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>(Yes, if you’ve been using <a href="../sync/atomic/struct.AtomicUsize.html" title="struct wasmer_types::lib::std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize"><code>AtomicUsize</code></a> for pointers in concurrent datastructures, you should
be using <a href="../sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html" title="struct wasmer_types::lib::std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr"><code>AtomicPtr</code></a> instead. If that messes up the way you atomically manipulate pointers,
we would like to know why, and what needs to be done to fix it.)</p>
<p>Situations where a valid pointer <em>must</em> be created from just an address, such as baremetal code
accessing a memory-mapped interface at a fixed address, cannot currently be handled with strict
provenance APIs and should use <a href="#exposed-provenance">exposed provenance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="exposed-provenance"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#exposed-provenance">§</a>Exposed Provenance</h3>
<p>As discussed above, integer-to-pointer casts are not possible with Strict Provenance APIs.
This is by design: the goal of Strict Provenance is to provide a clear specification that we are
confident can be formalized unambiguously and can be subject to precise formal reasoning.
Integer-to-pointer casts do not (currently) have such a clear specification.</p>
<p>However, there exist situations where integer-to-pointer casts cannot be avoided, or
where avoiding them would require major refactoring. Legacy platform APIs also regularly assume
that <code>usize</code> can capture all the information that makes up a pointer.
Bare-metal platforms can also require the synthesis of a pointer “out of thin air” without
anywhere to obtain proper provenance from.</p>
<p>Rust’s model for dealing with integer-to-pointer casts is called <em>Exposed Provenance</em>. However,
the semantics of Exposed Provenance are on much less solid footing than Strict Provenance, and
at this point it is not yet clear whether a satisfying unambiguous semantics can be defined for
Exposed Provenance. (If that sounds bad, be reassured that other popular languages that provide
integer-to-pointer casts are not faring any better.) Furthermore, Exposed Provenance will not
work (well) with tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>.</p>
<p>Exposed Provenance is provided by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.expose_provenance" title="method pointer::expose_provenance"><code>expose_provenance</code></a> and <a href="fn.with_exposed_provenance.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::with_exposed_provenance"><code>with_exposed_provenance</code></a> methods,
which are equivalent to <code>as</code> casts between pointers and integers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.expose_provenance" title="method pointer::expose_provenance"><code>expose_provenance</code></a> is a lot like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.addr" title="method pointer::addr"><code>addr</code></a>, but additionally adds the provenance of the
pointer to a global list of ‘exposed’ provenances. (This list is purely conceptual, it exists
for the purpose of specifying Rust but is not materialized in actual executions, except in
tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a>.)
Memory which is outside the control of the Rust abstract machine (MMIO registers, for example)
is always considered to be exposed, so long as this memory is disjoint from memory that will
be used by the abstract machine such as the stack, heap, and statics.</li>
<li><a href="fn.with_exposed_provenance.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::with_exposed_provenance"><code>with_exposed_provenance</code></a> can be used to construct a pointer with one of these previously
‘exposed’ provenances. <a href="fn.with_exposed_provenance.html" title="fn wasmer_types::lib::std::ptr::with_exposed_provenance"><code>with_exposed_provenance</code></a> takes only <code>addr: usize</code> as arguments, so
unlike in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.87.0/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.with_addr" title="method pointer::with_addr"><code>with_addr</code></a> there is no indication of what the correct provenance for the returned
pointer is – and that is exactly what makes integer-to-pointer casts so tricky to rigorously
specify! The compiler will do its best to pick the right provenance for you, but currently we
cannot provide any guarantees about which provenance the resulting pointer will have. Only one
thing is clear: if there is <em>no</em> previously ‘exposed’ provenance that justifies the way the
returned pointer will be used, the program has undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>If at all possible, we encourage code to be ported to <a href="#strict-provenance">Strict Provenance</a> APIs, thus avoiding
the need for Exposed Provenance. Maximizing the amount of such code is a major win for avoiding
specification complexity and to facilitate adoption of tools like <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> that can be
a big help in increasing the confidence in (unsafe) Rust code. However, we acknowledge that this
is not always possible, and offer Exposed Provenance as a way to explicit “opt out” of the
well-defined semantics of Strict Provenance, and “opt in” to the unclear semantics of
integer-to-pointer casts.</p>
