// TODO: The linker *can* exist in the runtime, since technically, there's nothing that
// prevents us from having a non-WASIX linker. However, there is currently no use-case
// for a non-WASIX linker, so we'll refrain from making it generic for the time being.

//! Linker for loading and linking dynamic modules at runtime. The linker is designed to
//! work with output from clang (version 19 was used at the time of creating this code).
//! Note that dynamic linking of WASM modules is considered unstable in clang/LLVM, so
//! this code may need to be updated for future versions of clang.
//!
//! The linker doesn't care about where code exists and how modules call each other, but
//! the way we have found to be most effective is:
//!     * The main module carries with it all of wasix-libc, and exports everything
//!     * Side module don't link wasix-libc in, instead importing it from the main module
//!
//! This way, we only need one instance of wasix-libc, and one instance of all the static
//! data that it requires to function. Indeed, if there were multiple instances of its
//! static data, it would more than likely just break completely; one needs only imagine
//! what would happen if there were multiple memory allocators (malloc) running at the same
//! time. Emscripten (the only WASM runtime that supports dynamic linking, at the time of
//! this writing) takes the same approach.
//!
//! While locating modules by relative or absolute paths is possible, it is recommended
//! to put every side module into /lib, where they can be located by name as well as by
//! path.
//!
//! The linker starts from a dynamically-linked main module. It scans the dylink.0 section
//! for memory and table-related information and the list of needed modules. The module
//! tree requires a memory, an indirect function table, and stack-related parameters
//! (including the __stack_pointer global), which are created. Since dynamically-linked
//! modules use PIC (position-independent code), the stack is not fixed and can be resized
//! at runtime.
//!
//! After the memory, function table and stack are created, the linker proceeds to load in
//! needed modules. Needed modules are always loaded in and initialized before modules that
//! asked for them, since it is expected that the needed module needs to be usable before
//! the module that needs it can be initialized.
//!
//! However, we also need to support circular dependencies between the modules; the most
//! common case is when the main needs a side module and imports function from it, and the
//! side imports wasix-libc functions from the main. To support this, the linker generates
//! stub functions for all the imports that cannot be resolved when a module is being
//! loaded in. The stub functions will then resolve the function once (and only once) at
//! runtime when they're first called. This *does*, however, mean that link errors can happen
//! at runtime, after the linker has reported successful linking of the modules. Such errors
//! are turned into a [`WasiError::DlSymbolResolutionFailed`] error and will terminate
//! execution completely.
//!
//! # Threading Support
//!
//! The linker supports the concept of "Instance Groups", which are multiple instances
//! of the same module tree. This corresponds very closely to WASIX threads, but is
//! named an instance group so as to keep the logic decoupled from the threading logic
//! in WASIX.
//!
//! Each instance group has its own store, indirect function table, and stack pointer,
//! but shares its memory with every other instance group. Note that even though the
//! underlying memory is the same, we need to create a new [`Memory`] instance
//! for each group via [`Memory::share_in_store`]. Also, when placing a symbol
//! in the function table, the linker always updates all function tables at the same
//! time. This is because function "pointers" can be passed across instance groups
//! (read: sent to other threads) by the guest code, so all function tables should
//! have exactly the same content at all times.
//!
//! One important aspect of instance groups is that they do *not* share the same store;
//! this lets us put different instance groups on different OS threads. However, this
//! also means that one call to [`Linker::load_module`], etc. cannot update every
//! instance group as each one has its own function table. To make the linker work
//! across threads, we need a "stop-the-world" lock on every instance group. The group
//! the load/resolve request originates from sets a flag, which other instance
//! groups are required to check periodically by calling [`Linker::do_pending_link_operations`].
//! Once all instance groups are stopped in that function, the original can proceed to
//! perform the operation, and report its results to all other instance groups so they
//! can make the same changes to their function table as well.
//!
//! In WASIX, the periodic check is performed at the start of most (but not all) syscalls.
//! This means a thread that doesn't make any syscalls can potentially block all other
//! threads if a DL operation is performed. This also means that two instance groups
//! cannot co-exist on the same OS thread, as the first one will block the OS thread
//! and the second can't enter the "lock" again to let the first continue its work.
//!
//! To also get cooperation from threads that are waiting in a syscall, a
//! [`Signal::Sigwakeup`](wasmer_wasix_types::wasi::Signal::Sigwakeup) signal is sent to
//! all threads when a DL operation needs to be synchronized.
//!
//! # About TLS
//!
//! Each instance of each group gets its own TLS area, so there are 4 cases to consider:
//!     * Main instance of main module: TLS area will be allocated by the compiler, and be
//!       placed at the start of the memory region requested by the `dylink.0` section.
//!     * Main instance of side modules: Almost same as main module, but tls_base will be
//!       non-zero because side modules get a non-zero memory_base. It is very important
//!       to note that the main instance of a side module lives in the instance group
//!       that initially loads it in. This **does not** have to be the main instance
//!       group.
//!     * Other instances of main module: Each worker thread gets its TLS area
//!       allocated by the code in pthread_create, and a pointer to the TLS area is passed
//!       through the thread start args. This pointer is read by the code in thread_spawn,
//!       and passed through to us as part of the environment's memory layout.
//!     * Other instances of side modules: This is where the linker comes in. When the
//!       new instance is created, the linker will call its `__wasix_init_tls` function,
//!       which is responsible for setting up the TLS area for the thread.
//!
//! Since we only want to call `__wasix_init_tls` for non-main instances of side modules,
//! it is enough to call it only within [`InstanceGroupState::instantiate_side_module_from_linker`].
//!
//! # Module Loading
//!
//! Module loading happens as an orchestrated effort between the shared linker state, the
//! state of the instance group that started (or "instigated") the operation, and other
//! instance groups. Access to a set of instances is required for resolution of exports,
//! which is why the linker state alone (which only stores modules) is not enough.
//!
//! Even though most (if not all) operations require access to both the shared linker state
//! and a/the instance group state, they're separated into three sets:
//!     * Operations that deal with metadata exist as impls on [`LinkerState`]. These take
//!       a (read-only) instance group state for export resolution, as well as a
//!       [`StoreRef`](wasmer::StoreRef). They're guaranteed not to alter the store or the
//!       instance group state.
//!     * Operations that deal with the actual instances (instantiating, putting symbols in the
//!       function table, etc.) and are started by the instigating group exist as impls on
//!       [`InstanceGroupState`] that also take a mutable reference to the shared linker state, and
//!       require it to be locked for writing. These operations can and will update the linker state,
//!       mainly to store symbol resolution records.
//!     * Operations that deal with replicating changes to instances from another thread also exits
//!       as impls on [`InstanceGroupState`], but take a read-only reference to the shared linker
//!       state. This is important because all the information needed for replicating the change to
//!       the instigating group's instances should already be in the linker state. See
//!       [`InstanceGroupState::populate_imports_from_linker`] and
//!       [`InstanceGroupState::instantiate_side_module_from_linker`] for the two most important ones.
//!
//! Module loading generally works by going through these steps:
//!     * [`LinkerState::load_module_tree`] loads modules (and their needed modules) and assigns
//!       module handles
//!     * Then, for each new module:
//!         * Memory and table space is allocated
//!         * Imports are resolved (see next section)
//!         * The module is instantiated
//!     * After all modules have been instantiated, pending imports (resulting from circular
//!       dependencies) are resolved
//!     * Finally, module initializers are called
//!
//! ## Symbol resolution
//!
//! To support replicating operations from the instigating group to other groups, symbol resolution
//! happens in 3 steps:
//!     * [`LinkerState::resolve_symbols`] goes through the imports of a soon-to-be-loaded module,
//!       recording the imports as [`NeededSymbolResolutionKey`]s and creating
//!       [`InProgressSymbolResolution`]s in response to each one.
//!     * [`InstanceGroupState::populate_imports_from_link_state`] then goes through the results
//!       and resolves each import to its final value, while also recording enough information (in the
//!       shape of [`SymbolResolutionResult`]s) for other groups to resolve the symbol from their own
//!       instances.
//!     * Finally, instances are created and finalized, and initializers are called.
//!
//! ## Stub functions
//!
//! As noted above, stub functions are generated in response to circular dependencies. The stub
//! functions do take previous symbol resolution records into account, so that the stub corresponding
//! to a single import cannot resolve to different exports in different groups. If no such record is
//! found, then a new record is created by the stub function. However, there's a catch.
//!
//! It must be noted that, during initialization, the shared linker state has to remain write-locked
//! so as to prevent other threads from starting another operation (the replication logic only works
//! with one active operation at a time). Stub functions need a write lock on the shared linker state
//! to store new resolution records, and as such, they can't store resolution records if they're
//! called in response to a module's initialization routines. This can happen easily if:
//! * A side module is needed by the main
//! * That side module accesses any libc functions, such as printing something to stdout.
//!
//! To work around this, stub functions only *try* to lock the shared linker state, and if they can't,
//! they won't store anything. A follow-up call to the stub function can resolve the symbol again,
//! store it for use by further calls to the function, and also create a resolution record. This does
//! create a few hard-to-reach edge cases:
//!     * If the symbol happens to resolve differently between the two calls to the stub, unpredictable
//!       behavior can happen; however, this is impossible in the current implementation.
//!     * If the shared state is locked by a different instance group, then the stub won't store its
//!       lookup results anyway, even though it could have if it had waited.
//!
//! ## Locating side modules
//!
//! Side modules are located according to these steps:
//!     * If the name contains a slash (/), it is treated as a relative or absolute path.   
//!     * Otherwise, the name is searched for in `/lib`, `/usr/lib` and `/usr/local/lib`.
//!       LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not supported yet.
//!
//! # Building dynamically-linked modules
//!
//! Note that building modules that conform the specific requirements of this linker requires
//! careful configuration of clang. A PIC sysroot is required. The steps to build a main
//! module are:
//!
//! ```bash
//! clang-19 \
//!   --target=wasm32-wasi --sysroot=/path/to/sysroot32-pic \
//!   -matomics -mbulk-memory -mmutable-globals -pthread \
//!   -mthread-model posix -ftls-model=local-exec \
//!   -fno-trapping-math -D_WASI_EMULATED_MMAN -D_WASI_EMULATED_SIGNAL \
//!   -D_WASI_EMULATED_PROCESS_CLOCKS \
//!   # PIC is required for all modules, main and side
//!   -fPIC \
//!   # We need to compile to an object file we can manually link in the next step
//!   -c main.c -o main.o
//!
//! wasm-ld-19 \
//!   # To link needed side modules, assuming `libsidewasm.so` exists in the current directory:
//!   -L. -lsidewasm \
//!   -L/path/to/sysroot32-pic/lib \
//!   -L/path/to/sysroot32-pic/lib/wasm32-wasi \
//!   # Make wasm-ld search everywhere and export everything, needed for wasix-libc functions to
//!   # be exported correctly from the main module
//!   --whole-archive --export-all \
//!   # The object file from the last step
//!   main.o \
//!   # The crt1.o file contains the _start and _main_void functions
//!   /path/to/sysroot32-pic/lib/wasm32-wasi/crt1.o \
//!   # Statically link the sysroot's libraries
//!   -lc -lresolv -lrt -lm -lpthread -lwasi-emulated-mman \
//!   # The usual linker config for wasix modules
//!   --import-memory --shared-memory --extra-features=atomics,bulk-memory,mutable-globals \
//!   --export=__wasm_signal --export=__tls_size --export=__tls_align \
//!   --export=__tls_base --export=__wasm_call_ctors --export-if-defined=__wasm_apply_data_relocs \
//!   # Again, PIC is very important, as well as producing a location-independent executable with -pie
//!   --experimental-pic -pie \
//!   -o main.wasm
//! ```
//!
//! And the steps to build a side module are:
//!
//! ```bash
//! clang-19 \
//!   --target=wasm32-wasi --sysroot=/path/to/sysroot32-pic \
//!   -matomics -mbulk-memory -mmutable-globals -pthread \
//!   -mthread-model posix -ftls-model=local-exec \
//!   -fno-trapping-math -D_WASI_EMULATED_MMAN -D_WASI_EMULATED_SIGNAL \
//!   -D_WASI_EMULATED_PROCESS_CLOCKS \
//!   # We need PIC
//!   -fPIC \
//!   # Make it export everything that's not hidden explicitly
//!   -fvisibility=default \
//!   -c side.c -o side.o
//!
//! wasm-ld-19 \
//!   # Note: we don't link against wasix-libc, so no -lc etc., because we want
//!   # those symbols to be imported.
//!   --extra-features=atomics,bulk-memory,mutable-globals \
//!   --export=__wasm_call_ctors --export-if-defined=__wasm_apply_data_relocs \
//!   # Need PIC
//!   --experimental-pic \
//!   # Import everything that's undefined, including wasix-libc functions
//!   --unresolved-symbols=import-dynamic \
//!   # build a shared library
//!   -shared \
//!   # Import a shared memory
//!   --shared-memory \
//!   # Conform to the libxxx.so naming so clang can find it via -lxxx
//!   -o libsidewasm.so side.o
//! ```
