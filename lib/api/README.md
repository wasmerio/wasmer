## Wasmer Embedding API

The `wasmer` crate is an embedding API of the `wasmer` WebAssembly runtime.
This is intended to be used in Rust projects and provides a high-level API of
working with WebAssembly modules.

If you're interested in embedding `wasmer` in other languages, you may wish to
take a look a the [C embedding API](../c-api) instead!
