[features]
# Enables generated code to emit events via the `tracing` crate whenever wasm is
# entered and when native functions are called. Note that tracin is currently
# only done for imported functions.
tracing = ["tracing-lib", "wai-bindgen-wasmer-impl/tracing"]

# Enables async support for generated code, although when enabled this still
# needs to be configured through the macro invocation.
