//! Unstable non-standard Wasmer-specific API that contains a Features

//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use wasmer_inline_c::assert_c;
//! # fn main() {
//! #    (assert_c! {
//! # #include "tests/wasmer.h"
//! #
//! int main() {
//!     // Declare features.
//!     wasmer_features_t* features = wasmer_features_new();
//!
//!     // Now, let's enable de SIMD feature.
//!     wasmer_features_simd(features, true);
//!
//!     // And also the memory64 feature.     
//!     wasmer_features_memory64(features, true);
//!
//!     wasmer_features_delete(features);
