//! Defining an engine in Wasmer is one of the fundamental steps.
//!
//! This example illustrates a neat feature of engines: their ability
//! to run in a headless mode. At the time of writing, all engines
//! have a headless mode, but it's not a requirement of the `Engine`
//! trait (defined in the `wasmer_engine` crate).
//!
//! What problem does it solve, and what does it mean?
//!
//! Once a Wasm module is compiled into executable code and stored
//! somewhere (e.g. in memory with the Universal engine), the module
//! can be instantiated and executed. But imagine for a second the
//! following scenario:
//!
//!   * Modules are compiled ahead of time, to be instantiated later
//!     on.
//!   * Modules are cross-compiled on a machine ahead of time
//!     to be run on another machine later one.
//!
//! In both scenarios, the environment where the compiled Wasm module
//! will be executed can be very constrained. For such particular
//! contexts, Wasmer can be compiled _without_ the compilers, so that
//! the `wasmer` binary is as small as possible. Indeed, there is no
//! need for a compiler since the Wasm module is already compiled. All
//! we need is an engine that _only_ drives the instantiation and
//! execution of the Wasm module.
//!
//! And that, that's a headless engine.
//!
//! To achieve such a scenario, a Wasm module must be compiled, then
//! serialized —for example into a file—, then later, potentially on
//! another machine, deserialized. The next steps are classical: The
//! Wasm module is instantiated and executed.
//!
//! This example uses a `compiler` because it illustrates the entire
//! workflow, but keep in mind the compiler isn't required after the
//! compilation step.
//!
//! You can run the example directly by executing in Wasmer root:
//!
//! ```shell
//! cargo run --example engine-headless --release --features "cranelift"
//! ```
//!
//! Ready?
